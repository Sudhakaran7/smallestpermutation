You are given an array A, you have to print lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than A, which can be made with one swap,
if it cannot done then return the same array.

Input Description:
n the size of array (1<n<100) in first line, in second line n elements of numbers in array A

Output Description:
print lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than A, if it cannot done return the same array

Sample Input:
3
4 3 2

Sample Output:
4 2 3

Explanation:
By swapping 2 and 3, we can get lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than A.

Sample Input:
5
1 2 4 3 5

Sample Output:
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Input:
6
6 3 2 4 1 5

Sample Output:
6 3 2 1 4 5

Sample Input:
4
1 1 3 4

Sample Output:
1 1 3 4

Sample Input:
6
12 32 24 56 22 60

Sample Output:
12 32 24 22 56 60

Sample Input:
